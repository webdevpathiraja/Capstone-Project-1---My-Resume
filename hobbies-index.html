    <p style="text-align: justify;">When I'm not coding, I love to immerse myself in activities that spark creativity and keep me inspired. I enjoy exploring the outdoors through hiking and photography, capturing the beauty of nature in every frame. I'm also an avid reader, constantly diving into books on technology, science fiction, and personal development. In my spare time, I like experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen and playing the guitar, finding that music and cooking provide a great balance to my technical pursuits. These hobbies not only refresh my mind but also fuel my passion for innovation and problem-solving in web development.</p>
